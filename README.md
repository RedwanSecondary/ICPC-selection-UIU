# ICPC-selection-UIU 2025
 
This GitHub repository contains a collection of C++ code files related to ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) problems. The repository is maintained by me and is intended for educational purposes, specifically for the ICPC selection process at the United International University (UIU).

### Main Function Points
- The repository includes various C++ code files that solve different ICPC problems, such as "1D Eraser", "Bacteria", "Circular Paths", "Counting Rooms", and "Target Practice".
- The code files are organized in a structured manner, with each file representing a specific problem solution.
- The repository serves as a resource for students preparing for the ICPC selection process at UIU, providing them with sample solutions to practice and learn from.

### Technology Stack
The project is written in C++, a widely-used programming language for competitive programming and algorithm development.

### License
The project does not specify a license, so the default copyright laws apply.
Students preparing for the ICPC selection/competitive programming at UIU can benefit from the following repository in several ways:

### 1. **Access to Sample Solutions**
   - The repository provides a collection of C++ code implementations for various ICPC problems. Students can study these solutions to understand different problem-solving techniques and coding styles.

### 2. **Practice Problems**
   - By working through the problems included in the repository, students can practice their coding skills in a competitive programming context, which is essential for ICPC preparation.

### 3. **Learning Algorithms and Data Structures**
   - The code examples often utilize various algorithms and data structures. Students can learn how to implement and apply these concepts effectively in real-world scenarios.

### 4. **Structured Learning**
   - The organization of the repository allows students to approach problems systematically, making it easier to track their progress and focus on specific areas where they need improvement.

### 5. **Debugging and Optimization**
   - Students can analyze the provided solutions to learn debugging techniques and optimization strategies, which are crucial skills in competitive programming.

### 6. **Collaboration and Discussion**
   - The GitHub platform allows for collaboration and discussion among students. They can contribute to the repository, suggest improvements, or ask questions about specific problems.

### 7. **Preparation for Team Competitions**
   - Since ICPC is a team-based competition, students can use the repository to practice collaboratively, simulating the team environment they will encounter during the actual contest.

### 8. **Familiarity with C++**
   - For students who are less familiar with C++, this repository serves as a practical resource to enhance their proficiency in the language, which is commonly used in competitive programming.

By leveraging these resources, anyone can enhance their coding skills, improve their problem-solving abilities, and increase their chances of success in the ICPC selection process.
